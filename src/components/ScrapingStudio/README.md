# ScrapingStudio Component

This is a refactored version of the ScrapingStudio component, broken down into smaller, more manageable components to improve maintainability and avoid TypeScript errors.

## Component Structure

The ScrapingStudio component has been broken down into the following smaller components:

1. **ScrapingStudioRefactored**: The main component that orchestrates all the other components.
2. **ScrapingHeader**: Handles the title and main action buttons.
3. **UrlInput**: Handles URL input, validation, and loading.
4. **BatchUrlsBar**: Manages batch URL operations.
5. **ProgressBar**: Displays scraping progress.
6. **BrowserPreview**: Displays the website preview and handles element selection.
7. **SelectorPanel**: Manages selected elements and their properties.
8. **ResultsPanel**: Displays and exports scraped data.

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import ScrapingStudioRefactored from '@/components/ScrapingStudio/ScrapingStudioRefactored';

const MyPage = () => {
  const handleExport = (data) => {
    console.log('Exported data:', data);
    // Handle the exported data
  };

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-4 h-screen">
      <ScrapingStudioRefactored onExport={handleExport} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyPage;
```

### Props

The `ScrapingStudioRefactored` component accepts the following props:

- `onExport`: (optional) A callback function that receives the scraped data when the user exports it.

## Features

1. **URL Loading**: Load any URL and view it in the browser preview.
2. **Element Selection**: Click on elements in the preview to select them for scraping.
3. **Batch Scraping**: Add multiple URLs to scrape in batch.
4. **Real-time Progress**: See the progress of scraping operations.
5. **Data Export**: Export scraped data in JSON or CSV format.

## Implementation Details

### Real Data vs. Mock Data

This implementation uses real data and API calls instead of mock data:

- The URL loading uses a proxy service to load external websites.
- The scraping functionality makes actual API calls to extract data.
- The export functionality generates real files with the scraped data.

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling is implemented throughout the components:

- URL validation and error messages
- Scraping error handling and display
- Export error handling

### TypeScript Support

All components are fully typed with TypeScript interfaces:

- `Selector`: Represents a selected element to scrape.
- `ScrapedItem`: Represents scraped data from a URL.

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller components are easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application.
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety throughout the application.
4. **Performance**: Smaller components result in more efficient rendering.
5. **Testing**: Smaller components are easier to test in isolation.

## Migration Guide

To migrate from the old ScrapingStudio component to this refactored version:

1. Import the new components from their respective files.
2. Replace the old `ScrapingStudio` component with `ScrapingStudioRefactored`.
3. Update any code that interacts with the component to use the new props and methods.

## Future Improvements

1. Add more export formats (e.g., Excel, XML).
2. Implement more advanced selector generation.
3. Add support for pagination and infinite scroll.
4. Implement more advanced error recovery mechanisms.
